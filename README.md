# GATK4 SNV (SNP/INDEL) germline pipeline

THis pipeline is based upon [Broad's  gatk-workflows/gatk4-germline-snps-indels repository][1].  We started with the WDL based on [commit 3bee02b5e843a83edc7f7dc25d8c10d3b06043bb][2], and started adjusting things from there.  This WDL was used for an approximately 34,000 sample cohort Joint Genotyping call set.
